1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,370
GILBERT STRANG: OK,
in this second part,

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,470
I'm going to start with linear
equations, A times x equal b.

3
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,770
And you see actually, the
first real good starting point

4
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,230
is A times x equals 0.

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,800
So are there any solutions to
the matrix, any combinations

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,250
of the columns that
give 0, any solutions

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,470
to A times x equals 0?

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,920
Now, I'm multiplying a matrix
A by a vector x in a way

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,170
you'll know.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,925
I take rows of x times,
it's called a dot product.

11
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,000
Rows of A times x.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,580
So I have a row of numbers.

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,650
And x is a column of numbers.

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,150
I multiply those numbers and
add to get the dot product.

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,630
And I'm wondering,
can I get 0 for each?

16
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,380
Is every row-- so
having a 0 there

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,490
is telling me, in geometry,
that that row is perpendicular,

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,130
orthogonal to that column.

19
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,730
If a row dot product
with a column

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,290
gives me a 0, then in
n dimensional space,

21
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,580
that row is perpendicular, 90
degree angle to that column x.

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,120
So I'm looking to see,
are there any vectors x

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
that are perpendicular
to all the rows?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,750
That's what Ax equals
0 is asking for.

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,220
Oh, and that's what I've
just said right there.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,840
I've used the word orthogonal.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,910
That's more of a high level
word than perpendicular.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,600
So I'll stay with that.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
It sounds a little cooler.

30
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,040
OK.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,770
And now, we can also
look at that transpose.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,710
Oh, do you know what the
transpose of a matrix is?

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,370
I take those rows
and flip the matrix,

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,460
so that those rows
become the columns.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,630
And the columns of A become
the rows of A transpose.

36
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,350
So I'll look at A
transpose times--

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,180
we'll call it y for
the new problem.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,940
A transpose y is all 0s.

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,490
And then the null space will
be any vector, any solutions,

40
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,440
any y that's perpendicular
to the rows of A transpose.

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,140
So I would need couple of hours
of teaching to develop this

42
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,630
properly because
we're talking here

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,570
about the fundamental theorem of
linear algebra, which tells me

44
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,090
that the vectors
in the null space,

45
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,830
like that, are perpendicular
to the vectors.

46
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,740
These guys are.

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,470
That's the row space.

48
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,170
Oh, but maybe I have told you.

49
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,820
We've said that, from this
equation, that tells you

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,330
the geometry that
that row vectors are

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,240
perpendicular to the x vector,
the thing in the null space.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,580
So x is there.

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,570
The rows are there.

54
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,370
And they're perpendicular.

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,850
Now, if I transpose
the matrix, remember

56
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,010
that means exchanging
rows and columns,

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,460
so I have a new
matrix, new size even.

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,620
It will the same--
but it's a matrix.

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,540
The same will be true for it.

60
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,290
The rows become the columns.

61
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,360
And the solutions to the new
equation with A transpose

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,940
go in that space.

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,100
So then that little
perpendicular sign

64
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,770
is reminding us of the geometry.

65
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,550
So rows perpendicular
to the x's.

66
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,710
Columns perpendicular
to the y's.

67
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,430
That's the best.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,130
I finally saw the
right way to say that.

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,380
So I have two pairs.

70
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,600
And I know how big each
of those four things are.

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,459
Those are the four fundamental
subspaces, two null spaces,

72
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,690
two solution spaces with 0.

73
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,980
Null means 0.

74
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,350
So these x's are in the null
space because of that 0.

75
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,450
Those are the n's.

76
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,170
And then this is the column
space and the row space.

77
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,130
So we've got four spaces
altogether, two pairs.

78
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,930
And now, you get to
see the big picture

79
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,530
of linear algebra, where the
four fundamental subspaces do

80
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,040
their thing.

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,910
There you go.

82
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,850
You can die happy now.

83
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,190
The row spaces there, those
are rows of the matrix,

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,060
independent rows of the matrix.

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,030
That's why I don't
put in all the rows.

86
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,230
There are m rows.

87
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,570
But I only put in
independent ones.

88
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,590
So that might be a smaller
number r, r the rank.

89
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,100
And here are the solutions,
the guys perpendicular to them.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,270
This is the rows of the matrix.

91
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,900
These are the vectors
perpendicular to it.

92
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,920
These are the columns
of the matrix.

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,730
These are the vectors
perpendicular to the columns.

94
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,220
You see it's just
a natural splitting

95
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:31,580
of the whole spaces of vectors
into two pieces and two pieces.

96
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,680
And I think of the matrix A,
when it multiplies stuff there,

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,570
it gives stuff here.

98
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,440
When A multiplies
a vector x, you

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,910
get a combination
of the columns.

100
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,310
That with the very,
very first slide.

101
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,150
A times x is a combination
of the columns.

102
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,390
And then we look at
some x's, if there are

103
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,890
any, where A times x gives 0.

104
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,650
And there's 0 right there.

105
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,350
OK.

106
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,010
OK, so that's the big picture.

107
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,040
And I'll just point to
another little point

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,700
that's hiding in this picture.

109
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,280
You see that little symbol
there, that little thing,

110
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,580
and it's also here?

111
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,120
What that means is
that those guys are

112
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,190
perpendicular to these.

113
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,840
And these are
perpendicular to these.

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,880
So we have four subspaces, two
pairs, two perpendicular pairs.

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,070
And that's when you get the
idea of knowing what they mean,

116
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,270
knowing how to find them,
at least for a small matrix,

117
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,700
you've got the heart of
linear algebra part one.

118
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,230
This is the first half
of linear algebra.

119
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,040
OK, I'll just see
what else there is.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh, here, oh, well,
this is another comment.

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,470
I've hardly told you how
to multiply two matrices.

122
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,980
The usual way is
rows times columns.

123
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,030
But linear algebra being
always interesting,

124
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,490
there's another
way that I happen

125
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,840
to like, columns times rows.

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,690
Now, there is a
column times a row.

127
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,860
Now, column times a row,
we've seen that once

128
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,820
for that rank one matrix.

129
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,240
Do you remember I said
that those rank one

130
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,020
matrix, one column times is one
row are the building blocks?

131
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,580
Well, here is the building.

132
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,660
Those are n of those blocks.

133
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,640
A column times a row,
a column times a row.

134
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,730
And here is a reminder of the--

135
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,160
oh, we've only--
oh, we're coming up

136
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
to A equal LU, the first one.

137
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Get on with it,
Professor Strang.

138
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,570
OK.

139
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,700
OK, now we're solving equations.

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,180
Now we're going to get
L times U. So right.

141
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,140
So there's two equations and two
unknowns solved in high school

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,160
and how.

143
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,300
Do you remember how?

144
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,800
That's the whole point.

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,320
If I take twice that equation,
so it's 4x plus 6y equal 14,

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,110
and subtract from
this one, then I

147
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,980
get an easy equation
for only y by itself.

148
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,030
So that's what I did.

149
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,310
That's called elimination.

150
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,290
I eliminated this 4x.

151
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,030
It's gone.

152
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,400
It's 2 times that.

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,550
That's why I chose
to multiply it by 2.

154
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,000
Then 2 times this
gives me 4 x's.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,250
When I subtract it, it's gone
and I'm left with 1y equal 1.

156
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,980
So I know the answer y equal 1.

157
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,080
And then I go backwards to
x equal 2 because 2x plus,

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,900
this is now, 3 equals 7.

159
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,830
2x is 4.

160
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,900
x is 2.

161
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,500
And the real point
about linear algebra

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,790
done right is that
all those steps

163
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,510
can be expressed as a
break up, another way

164
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,860
to break up the matrix A into
a lower triangular matrix.

165
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,100
You see that that
matrix is triangular.

166
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,720
It's lower triangular.

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,430
And this one is
upper triangular.

168
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,790
So those are called
L and U. Yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,820
So what we did here is expressed
by that matrix multiplication.

170
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,550
You really want to express
everything, in the end,

171
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,190
as multiplying a
couple of matrices.

172
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,370
Then you know exactly
where you are.

173
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,340
So that's the idea
of elimination.

174
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,450
And now, we only were
doing a 2 by 2 matrix.

175
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,660
You remember our little matrix
was pathetic, 2, 3, 4, 7.

176
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,110
That was our matrix A.
We can't stop there.

177
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,550
So linear algebra goes
on to matrix of any size.

178
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,980
And this is the way
to find the triangular

179
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,920
factor L and the upper
triangular factor

180
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,730
U. That would need more time.

181
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,560
So all I want to say is,
when you're doing elimination

182
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,490
solving equations, then
in the back of your mind

183
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,320
or in the back page, you are
producing an L matrix lower

184
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,700
and a U matrix upper.

185
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,550
So yeah.

186
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,170
Let me see.

187
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,470
Yeah, here we see them.

188
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,150
The L matrix is all 0s above.

189
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,670
The U matrix is all 0s below.

190
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,080
And that's what is
really happening.

191
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,470
So that's what computer
system totally focuses on.

192
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,150
OK, that's the first
slide of a new part.

193
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,470
So I'll stop here and coming
back to orthogonal vectors.

194
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,020
Good.
